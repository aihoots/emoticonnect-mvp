nltk==3.6.3
python-dotenv==0.19.1
requests==2.26.0


# Now, let's explain the requirements and their purposes:

# nltk==3.6.3

# NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is used for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization and stop word removal.
# We use it in the preprocess_input function to tokenize the text and remove stop words.


# anthropic==0.2.9

# This is the official Python client for the Anthropic API, which we use to interact with Claude.
# It's used in the recognize_emotion function when the model is set to "claude".


# openai==0.27.0

# This is the official Python client for the OpenAI API, which we use to interact with ChatGPT.
# It's used in the recognize_emotion function when the model is set to "chatgpt".


# python-dotenv==0.19.1

# This library is used to load environment variables from a .env file.
# We use it to securely store and access API keys without hardcoding them in the script.



# Here's a breakdown of how these requirements are used in the code:

# NLTK is used in the preprocess_input function for tokenization and stop word removal.
# The Anthropic and OpenAI libraries are used in the recognize_emotion function to make API calls to Claude and ChatGPT respectively.
# python-dotenv is used at the beginning of the script to load the API keys from the .env file.
